# Source and design of blog/website for aaronbarack.com


## What I Plan on creating:
1. A blog showing what I've worked on
2. A Resume
3. Possibly other things.

## Design model based on The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman:

Notes: I am building this based on what is conveyed from chapter one. I am still currently reading the book so not everything will be necessarily finalized. Based on chapter 1 it gives a really good framework that be made from answering the questions below. I am experimenting really if this goes well I might use this in the future for other projects.

### What needs to be indicated to the user?
    1. What is possible, what actions can I do?
    2. What is happening on screen?
    3. What is about to happen?
    4. Communication especially when things go wrong.

### Principles of design:
  1. Discoverability
    - What the website does
    - How it works
    - What operations are possible?

## The five Psychological aspects of Discoverability:
  1. What affordances are made?
  2. What are the signifies?
  3. What are the constraints?
  4. How are actions mapped?
  5. What kind of feedback will be given?
  6. What does the design and user conceptual model look like?
